# PHAS0052: Group Project
> Simluating the Mpemba effect using LAMMPS & VMD

---

PHAS0052 is a third year module at UCL:

> This module aims to teach students how to function effectively in a group, simulating a professional working environment, tackling a problem in physics requiring group co-operation for its solutions. The technical skills exercised in the collective solution of the set problem rely on practical skills developed through earlier academic study in Physics.

> Topics:
> Students take part in training in group interaction and management. They then practice these skills in small groups by attempting the solutions of a complex technical problem in physics which requires group co-operation for its solutions.

> Structure: Three lectures, 77 hours of independent project work, 10 hours of written work (essays), 12 hours problem classes/discussion. A presentation by students of their project

Our project is on investigating supercooling and the Mpemba effect. Part of that project includes some molecular dynamics simulations --> here we are!
