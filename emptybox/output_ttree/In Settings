  # -- Unfortunately LAMMPS itself does not understand molemlate syntax, so
  # -- the atoms are identified by order in the list, not by name.  (The "mW" 
  # -- refers to to an identifier in the system.in.sw file, not watmw.lt.)
  # -- This command says that the first atom type corresponds to the "mW"
  # -- atom in system.in.sw, and to ignore the remaining three atom types
  # -- (correspond to the CH2, CH3, CH4 atom types defined in trappe1998.lt.
  # --  We don't want to use the "sw" force field for interactions involving 
  # --  these atom types, so we put "NULL" there.)
  # -- Note: For this to work, you should probably run moltemplate this way:
  # --     moltemplate.sh -a "@atom:WatMW/mW 1" system.lt
  # -- This assigns the atom type named @atom:WatMW/mW to 1  (the first atom)
